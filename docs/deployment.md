<h1>Deployment</h1>

## Run-time vs. Build-time

This platform compiles to a static website, which means that it can be deployed to any host that can serve files (most notably Github's free "GitHub Pages" offering). At run-time, it requires no server-side technologies.

That said, the platform does require some server-side technologies to *build* the site. At build-time, this platform requires Python and Ruby.

## Automation services

The easiest way to perform these builds is to use a free automation service like TravisCI or CircleCI. Alternatives such as self-hosted Jenkins are possible, but require more maintenance and likely would not be free.

> the tasks mentioned in this document, using CircleCI for automation.

## Hosting providers

Once the platform has been built, it simply needs to be uploaded to a hosting provider. GitHub's free "GitHub Pages" offering is the easiest host to use, since it only requires committing the built files to a certain Git branch. This documentation will assume the use of GitHub Pages as a host.

However, alternatives are easy â€” after all, it's merely uploading files.

## Staging vs Production

It is helpful to have both a "staging" and "production" version of the site, in order to preview changes (staging) before they are presented to the public (production). If using GitHub Pages as a host, the simplest way to do this to create a second GitHub account specifically for the purpose of hosting the production site.

## Deployment overview for the two repositories

Implementing this platform requires 2 separate repositories, which we call the "site repository" and the "data repository". A deployment workflow will need to be set up for both of these repositories.

### Deploying the data repository

To deploy the data repository requires these tasks (which, again, are pre-configured in the starter repositories):

1. Validate the data and metadata to ensure quality
1. Convert the data (CSV) and metadata (YAML) into optimized JSON format
1. Upload the built files to the hosting provider

### Deploying the site repository

To deploy the site repository requires these tasks (which, again, are pre-configured in the starter repositories):

1. Build the Jekyll site
1. Validate the HTML of the site to ensure quality
1. Upload the built files to the hosting provider
